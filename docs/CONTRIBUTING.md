## <span id="bugs">Reporting Bugs</span>

Please file bugs in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/covalenthq/refiner). Include at
least the following:

* What happened.
* What did you expect to happen instead of what *did* happen, if it's
   not crazy obvious.
* What operating system, operating system version and version of
   `refiner` you are running.
* Console log entries, where possible and relevant.

If you're not sure whether something is relevant, erring on the side of too much information will never be a cause for concern.

## <span id="general_procedure">General Procedure</span>

Contributing to this repo can mean many things such as participating in discussion or proposing code changes. To ensure a smooth workflow for all contributors, the following general procedure for contributing has been established:

1. Either [open](https://github.com/covalenthq/refiner/issues/new/choose)
   or [find](https://github.com/covalenthq/refiner/issues) an issue you have identified and would like to contribute to
   resolving.

2. Participate in thoughtful discussion on that issue.

3. If you would like to contribute:
    1. If the issue is a proposal, ensure that the proposal has been accepted by the Covalent team.
    2. Ensure that nobody else has already begun working on the same issue. If someone already has, please make sure to contact the individual to collaborate.
    3. If nobody has been assigned the issue and you would like to work on it, make a comment on the issue to inform the
       community of your intentions to begin work. Ideally, wait for confirmation that no one has started it. However,
       if you are eager and do not get a prompt response, feel free to dive on in!
    4. Follow standard Github best practices:
        1. Fork the repo
        2. Branch from the HEAD of `develop`(For core developers working within the `refiner` repo, to ensure a clear ownership of branches, branches must be named with the convention `{moniker}/{issue#}-branch-name`).
        3. Make commits
        4. Submit a PR to `develop`
    5. Be sure to submit the PR in `Draft` mode. Submit your PR early, even if it's incomplete as this indicates to the community you're working on something and allows them to provide comments early in the development process.
    6. When the code is complete it can be marked `Ready for Review`.
    7. Be sure to include a relevant change log entry in the `Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md` (see file for log
       format).
    8. Please make sure to run `mix format mix.exs "lib/**/*.{ex,exs}" "test/**/*.{ex,exs}" "config/*.{ex,exs}"` before every commit - the easiest way to do this is having your editor run it for you upon saving a file. Additionally, please ensure that your code is lint compliant by running `mix deps.get, mix deps.compile` .
   There are CI tests built into the `refiner` repository and all PRâ€™s will require that these tests pass before they are able to be merged.

**Note**: for very small or blatantly obvious problems (such as typos), it is not required to open an issue to submit a PR, but be aware that for more complex problems/features, if a PR is opened before an adequate design discussion has taken place in a github issue, that PR runs a high likelihood of being rejected.

some [good first issues](https://github.com/covalenthq/refiner/issues).

### <span id="dev_procedure">Development Procedure</span>

1. The latest state of development is on `main`.
2. `main` must never
   fail `mix format --check-formatted, mix credo`
3. No `--force` onto `main` (except when reverting a broken commit, which should seldom happen).
4. Create your feature branch from `main` either on `github.com/covalenthq/refiner`, or your fork (
   using `git remote add origin`).
5. Before submitting a pull request, begin `git rebase` on top of `main`.
6. Code must adhere to the official elixir [formatting](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/main/Mix.Tasks.Format.html) guidelines.
7. Code must be documented adhering to the official Elixir [commentary](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide) guidelines.
8. Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the `main` branch.
9. Commit messages should be prefixed with the package(s) they modify.
   * E.g. "eth, rpc: make trace configs optional"

### <span id="dependencies">Dependencies</span>

We use [Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) to manage dependency versions.

The main branch of every `refiner` repository should just build with `mix deps.get, mix deps.compile`, which means they should be kept up-to-date with their dependencies, so we can get away with telling people they can just `mix deps.get` our software. Since some dependencies are not under our control, a third party may break our build, in which case we can fall back on `rm -rf _build deps && mix clean && mix deps.get && mix deps.compile`.

### <span id="testing">Testing</span>

Covalent uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automated [integration testing](https://github.com/covalenthq/refiner/actions).

### <spand id="linting">Linting</span>

The repo uses `credo` to run linters and enforce coding standards. There are two ways to run this:

* run `mix credo --all`
* run `mix credo explain Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleDoc`

### <span id="braching_model_and_release">Branching Model and Release</span>

User-facing repos should adhere to the [trunk based development branching model](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

Libraries need not follow the model strictly, but would be wise to.
`refiner` utilizes [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### <span id="pr_targeting">PR Targeting</span>

Ensure that you base and target your PR on the `main` branch.
All feature additions should be targeted against `main`. Bug fixes for an outstanding release candidate should be
targeted against the release candidate branch.

### <span id="pull_requests">Pull Requests</span>

To accommodate the review process, we suggest that PRs are categorically broken up. Ideally each PR addresses only a single issue. Additionally, as much as possible code refactoring and cleanup should be submitted as separate PRs from bug fixes/feature-additions.

### <span id="reviewing_prs">Process for reviewing PRs</span>

All PRs require two Reviews before merge. When reviewing PRs, please use the following review explanations:

1. `LGTM` without an explicit approval means that the changes look good, but you haven't pulled down the code, run tests, locally and thoroughly reviewed it.
2. `Approval` through the GH UI means that you understand the code, documentation/spec is updated in the right places,
   you have pulled down and tested the code locally. In addition:
    * You must think through whether any added code could be partially combined (DRYed) with existing code.
    * You must think through any potential security issues or incentive-compatibility flaws introduced by the changes.
    * Naming convention must be consistent with the rest of the codebase.
    * Code must live in a reasonable location, considering dependency structures (e.g. not importing testing modules in
      production code, or including example code modules in production code).
    * If you approve of the PR, you are responsible for fixing any of the issues mentioned here.
3. If you are only making "surface level" reviews, submit any notes as `Comments` without adding a review.

### <span id="pull_merge_procedure">Pull Merge Procedure</span>

1. Ensure pull branch is rebased on `main`.
2. Ensure that all CI tests and checks pass.
3. Merge pull request @author.
